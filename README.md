<p>
Forensic tire tread evidence records and analyzes impressions of vehicle tire treads for use in legal proceedings to help prove the identities of persons at a crime scene. Every tire will show different amounts of tread wear, and different amounts of damage in the form of tiny cuts and nicks.

#### What are TYRE marks in forensic science? 

<p>
The tyre marks are also like footprints, either two-dimensional prints or three-dimensional impressions depending upon the surface on which they are present. Skid marks are the marks left by wheels of motor vehicles, which are no longer rotating.
