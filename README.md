<p>
Forensic tire tread evidence records and analyzes impressions of vehicle tire treads for use in legal proceedings to help prove the identities of persons at a crime scene. Every tire will show different amounts of tread wear, and different amounts of damage in the form of tiny cuts and nicks.
</p>


### Description
#### What are TYRE marks in forensic science?

<p>
The tyre marks are also like footprints, either two-dimensional prints or three-dimensional impressions depending upon the surface on which they are present. Skid marks are the marks left by wheels of motor vehicles, which are no longer rotating.

### Important HTTP STATUS CODE
<p>
Here's a list of some of the most common HTTP status codes, along with their meanings and functions:
<ul>
<li> <b> 1xx Informational codes: </b> </li>
These codes indicate that the request has been received and is being processed. Some common examples include: <br>

100 Continue: The server has received the request headers and is waiting for the client to send the request body.
101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching to a different protocol (e.g. from HTTP to WebSocket).


<li> <b> 2xx Success codes: </b> </li>
These codes indicate that the request was successful. Some common examples include: <br>

** 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested data.

** 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created on the server.

** 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no data to return.


<li> <b> 3xx Redirection codes: </b> </li>
These codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action to complete the request. Some common examples include: <br>

** 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.

** 302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.

** 304 Not Modified: The client's cached copy of the resource is still valid, so the server is not returning a new copy.


<li> <b> 4xx Client error codes: </b> </li>
These codes indicate that there was an error on the client's side of the request. Some common examples include: <br>

** 400 Bad Request: The request was malformed or invalid.

** 401 Unauthorized: The client needs to provide authentication credentials to access the requested resource.

** 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.


<li> <b> 5xx Server error codes: </b> </li>
These codes indicate that there was an error on the server side of the request. Some common examples include:

** 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

** 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request.

** There are many other HTTP status codes beyond these examples, but these are some of the most commonly used.

</ul>
